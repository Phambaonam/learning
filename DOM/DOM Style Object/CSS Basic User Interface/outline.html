                At times, style sheet authors may want to create outlines around visual objects such as buttons, active form fields, image maps, etc., to make them stand out.
                Outlines differ from borders in the following ways:

                Outlines do not take up space.
                Outlines may be non-rectangular.
                UAs often render outlines on elements in the :focus state.
                The outline properties control the style of these dynamic outlines.

                The stacking of the rendering of these outlines is explicitly left up to implementations to provide a better user experience per platform. 
                This supersedes the stacking of outlines as defined in CSS 2.1.
