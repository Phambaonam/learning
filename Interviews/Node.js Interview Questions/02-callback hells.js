// callback hells


/*
There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:

modularization: break callbacks into independent functions
use a control flow library, like async
use generators with Promises
use async/await (note that it is only available in the latest v7 release and not in the LTS version - you can read our experimental async/await how-to here)
