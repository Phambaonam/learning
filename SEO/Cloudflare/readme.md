## What does Rocket Loader do?  


https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168056-What-does-Rocket-Loader-do-



1. Adding the 'data-cfasync' attribute within JS will not work to exclude the script from Rocket Loader.
2. The 'data-cfasync' attribute must be added before the 'src' attribute. 
3. Rocket loader will recognize the tag when either single or double quotes are placed around the attribute value.
