## The this Keyword  


In JavaScript, the thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code.

The value of this, when used in a function, is the object that "owns" the function.

The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.

The this keyword in an object constructor does not have a value. It is only a substitute for the new object.

The value of this will become the new object when the constructor is used to create an object.

Note that this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.
