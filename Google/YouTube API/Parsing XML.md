# Parsing XML





Parsing XML
XML (which stands for E xtensible Markup Language) is very similar to HTMLâ€”it uses tags between angle brackets. The difference is that XML allows you to use tags that you make up, rather than tags that the W3C decided on. For instance, you could create an API that returns information about a pet:

<pet>
    <name>Jeffrey</name>
    <species>Giraffe</species>
</pet>

As long as you document the structure of your API's response, other people can use your API to get information about <pet>s.
