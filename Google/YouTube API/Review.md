REST Constraints & Requirements
Quiz time! Let's see if you remember the major points of HTTP and REST.




// 1. HTTP is a protocol that connects clients and ______.
var answer1 = "servers";

// 2. The four HTTP methods are GET, POST, ___, and DELETE.
var answer2 = "PUT"

// 3. A ___ error means the server goofed up. (200, 300, 400, or 500)
var answer3 = "500";





Requests
All right! Let's see if you can make that request to codecademy.com all on your lonesome.




Go ahead and do three things:

Create a variable called xhr and set it equal to new XMLHttpRequest().
Call open xhr and pass it three arguments: "GET" (the type of request you'd like to make), "https://www.codecademy.com/" (the URL), and false (this means the exercise will wait until it gets a response from the server).
Call .send() on xhr. We've already taken care of the console.log()s for you!



false 
(this means the exercise will wait until it gets a response from the server).
