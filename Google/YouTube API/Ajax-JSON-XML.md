# Ajax ? JSON : XML



XML or JSON?
This leads us to wonder, though: how do we know whether an API will reply with XML or JSON?

The only way you'll know what type of data an API will send you is to read that API's documentation! Some will reply with one, and some will reply with the other. Documentation is a programmer's best friend, and it's always in your best interest to read it so you understand that what the API expects from you and what the API intends to send you when you make a request.









REST Constraints & Requirements
Quiz time! Let's see if you remember the major points of HTTP and REST.




The Four Verbs

The number of HTTP methods you'll use is quite smallâ€”there are just four HTTP "verbs" you'll need to know! They are:


GET: 

retrieves information from the specified source (you just saw this one!)

POST: 

sends new information to the specified source.

PUT: 

updates existing information of the specified source.

DELETE: 

removes existing information from the specified source.
So when we sent our GET request to codecademy.com, we retrieved information. When you add to or update your blog, you're sending POST or PUT requests; when you delete a tweet, there goes a DELETE request.





GET: POST: PUT: DELETE:
