Use HTTP Verbs to Make Your Requests Mean Something
API consumers are capable of sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs, which greatly enhance the clarity of a given request.

Generally, the four primary HTTP verbs are used as follows:


## GET

Read a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources.

## PUT

Update a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources. Can also be used to create a specific resource if the resource identifier is know before-hand.

## DELETE

Remove/delete a specific resource by an identifier.

## POST

Create a new resource. Also a catch-all verb for operations that don't fit into the other categories.
