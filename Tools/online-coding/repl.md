## repl (Read–eval–print loop)  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop  


A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also known as an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.
