Let’s have a look at what you’ll learn in the course:


## Animating in the Browser

Setting the scene for the course and looking at the benefits and principles of animation.

## Transitions – From A to B

Learn to add smooth transitions as styles change between two states.

## Keyframe Animations

Learn how to craft more complex motion with the `@keyframes` and `animation` properties; first the theory and then practical examples.

## Easing and Timing Functions

Discover how to add character and control the timing of your animations with easing and cubic bezier functions.

## Putting it all Together

Taking things to the next level, we’ll combine effects to create multiple transitions and multiple animations.

## Browser Considerations

We’ll discuss browser support, vendor prefixes and performance considerations to make sure your animations work on as many devices as possible.

## Accessibility and Animations

Finally, we’ll tackle accessibility concerns and ensure our animations don’t cause issues by being distracting or cause motion sickness.
