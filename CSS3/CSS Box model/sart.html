            Wouldn't it be useful also to define the behavior of `::before` and 
            `::after` for void and (especially) replaced elements more 
            specifically, with regard to the current behavior of the browsers? 
            E.g., all browsers currently support these pseudo-elements for `hr` 
            (and `hr::before { content: "\2727\2003\2003\2727\2003\2003\2727"; }` 
            is widely used in the new design of W3C specs themselves), although 
            this element [is defined as 
            void](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/syntax.html#void-elements) in HTML.
             Also, almost all browsers don't apply them to regular `img` elements,
             but do apply for broken `img`s 
            (https://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/). Since the difference 
            between regular and broken differ in their browser Shadow DOM 
            structure ([at least in Blink 
            browsers](http://css-live.ru/Primer/pseudos/chrome-img-shadow-dom.png)),
             maybe  the behavior of pseudo elements also could be described in 
            Shadow DOM terms?
