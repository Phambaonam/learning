            Custom scrollbars for IE, 
            Chrome and Firefox using CSS

            Using Custom scrollbars in your website can be really eye-catching and they go well with the website’s design. 
            For web designers, it’s difficult creating them with JavaScript. 
            Instead, you can create custom scrollbars using CSS. 
            According to my acknowledge, it only worked in Internet Explorer.
            During my recent project, my client required the scrollbar to be stylized with CSS, and make it work in most mainstream browsers. 
            So after a bit of googling, I found the tricks to do so and share them with you here.
