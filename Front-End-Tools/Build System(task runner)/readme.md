为什么要使用任务运行器？

一句话：自动化。  
在执行重复性任务（例如缩小，编译，单元测试，棉绒等）时，您所做的工作越少，您的工作就越容易。

The Build System is used to build, preview and test your project.  


The Package Manager is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts.  


yo scaffolds out a new application, writing your build configuration (e.g Gulpfile) and pulling in relevant build tasks and package manager dependencies (e.g npm) that you might need for your build.
