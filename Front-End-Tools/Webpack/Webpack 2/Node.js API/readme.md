# Node.js API


https://webpack.js.org/api/node/











To start using webpack Node.js API, first install webpack if you havenâ€™t yet:

```
$ npm install webpack --save-dev

``` 

Then require the webpack module in your Node.js script:

```
const webpack = require("webpack");

// Or if you prefer ES2015:
import webpack from "webpack";

``` 





```
const webpack = require("webpack");

webpack(
    {
        // Configuration Object
    }, 
    (err, stats) => {
        if (err || stats.hasErrors()) {
            // Handle errors here
        }
        // Done processing
    }
);
```
