The Build System is used to build, preview and test your project.  


The Package Manager is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts.  


yo scaffolds out a new application, writing your build configuration (e.g Gulpfile) and pulling in relevant build tasks and package manager dependencies (e.g npm) that you might need for your build.
